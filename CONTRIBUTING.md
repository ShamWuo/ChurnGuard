Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

Guidelines
- Open a GitHub issue first to discuss larger features or breaking changes.
- Keep changes small and focused; a single PR should do one logical thing.
- Follow existing code style and TypeScript types; run `npm test` before submitting.

Development workflow
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Run the test suite and precompile templates locally:

```powershell
npm install
npm run precompile-templates
npm test
```

3. Open a pull request with a short description, screenshots (if UI), and a test or note explaining manual steps.

Code of conduct
- Please be respectful and professional. Treat this repo like a collaborative workplace.
