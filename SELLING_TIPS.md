# Selling tips & demo talking points

Elevator pitch
- "Recover lost revenue from failed payments — set up in minutes, integrate with Stripe, and start recovering lost customers automatically."

Demo talking points
- Quick win: show how the admin UI surfaces failed invoice events and suggests recovery actions.
- ROI: estimate recovered revenue (% of failed payments) and show a sample recovered-revenue report.
- Time to value: claim a short setup time (15–30 minutes) and show Checkout + Billing Portal flow.

Common buyer objections and answers
- "We already have billing in Stripe" — This complements Stripe: it automates retries, emails, and recovery offers, and provides audit logs and metrics.
- "We don't want more charges to our customers" — Use Safe Mode and Dry Runs to validate before enabling real charges; use trials for testing.
- "How do you handle security and data retention?" — Recommend Postgres, secret managers, enable HSTS/CSP, and provide export/deletion endpoints on request.

Close script
- Offer a 14-day free trial, then standard monthly plans. For enterprise, offer an onboarding and integration package.
